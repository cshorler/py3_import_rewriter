This is a small library that rewrites a modules imports

Why?
I wanted to import readline callbacks, and there are very long
discussions on when this will be available in core CPython.

Also, an interesting opportunity to further my Python 3 knowledge

Use / test:
1. Create a new venv
2. use pip to pull in testing-req.txt (requirements file)
3. source the venv
4. run the tests
5. try out the turtle demo from the python docs (help is there too)
   - quick start at the prompt:  playback spiral.cmd
   - bye to quit
6. launching turtle demo in pdb won't work (pdb loads cmd)
   - workaround using comments at top of turtle demo program
